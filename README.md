# challenge1-horiseon

## Description

Challenge 1 for UNB Coding Bootcamp. Legacy html and CSS was provided and the task was to refactor it to adhere to semantic html standards for purproses of accessibility and search engine optimization. By completing this project I learned the how to replace <div> tags with semantic elements, how to consolidate and streamline CSS and how to do both of these things while leaving the structure and function of the original website the same but with cleaner, more streamlined html and CSS.
